                Wings are airfoils that, when moved rapidly through the air, 
                create lift. They are built in many shapes and sizes. Wing design 
                can vary to provide certain desirable flight characteristics. 
                Control at various operating speeds, the amount of lift generated, 
                balance, and stability all change as the shape of the wing is 
                altered. Both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the wing 
                may be straight or curved, or one edge may be straight and the 
                other curved. One or both edges may be tapered so that the wing 
                is narrower at the tip than at the root where it joins the 
                fuselage. The wing tip may be square, rounded, or even pointed. 
                [Figure 1-1] shows a number of typical wing leading and trailing 
                edge shapes.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The wings of an aircraft can be attached to the fuselage at 
                the top, mid-fuselage, or at the bottom. They may extend 
                perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the fuselage or 
                can angle up or down slightly. This angle is known as the 
                wing dihedral. The dihedral angle affects the lateral 
                stability of the aircraft. [Figure 1-2] shows some common 
                wing attach points and dihedral angle.

                Wing Structure</br>
                机翼结构
            </h2>
            <p class="text">
                The wings of an aircraft are designed to lift it into 
                the air. Their particular design for any given 
                aircraft depends on a number of factors, such as size, 
                weight, use of the aircraft, desired speed in flight and 
                at landing, and desired rate of 
                climb. The wings of aircraft are designated left and right,
                corresponding to the left and right sides of the operator when
                seated in the flight deck. [Figure 1-3]
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Often wings are of full cantilever design. This means they
                are built so that no external bracing is needed. They are
                supported internally by structural members assisted by the
                skin of the aircraft. Other aircraft wings use external struts
                or wires to assist in supporting the wing and carrying the
                aerodynamic and landing loads. Wing support cables and
                struts are generally made from steel. Many struts and their
                attach fittings have fairings to reduce drag. Short, nearly
                vertical supports called jury struts are found on struts that
                attach to the wings a great distance from the fuselage. This
                serves to subdue strut movement and oscillation caused by
                the air flowing around the strut in flight. [Figure 1-4] shows
                samples of wings using external bracing, also known as
                semicantilever wings. Cantilever wings built with no external 
                bracing are also shown.

            <p class="text">
                Aluminum is the most common material from which to
                construct wings, but they can be wood covered with fabric,
                and occasionally a magnesium alloy has been used. Moreover,
                modern aircraft are tending toward lighter and stronger
                materials throughout the airframe and in wing construction.
                Wings made entirely of carbon fiber or other composite
                materials exist, as well as wings made of a combination of
                materials for maximum strength to weight performance.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The internal structures of most wings are made up of spars
and stringers running spanwise and ribs and formers or
bulkheads running chordwise (leading edge to trailing edge).
The spars are the principle structural members of a wing.
They support all distributed loads, as well as concentrated
weights such as the fuselage, landing gear, and engines. The
skin, which is attached to the wing structure, carries part of
the loads imposed during flight. It also transfers the stresses
to the wing ribs. The ribs, in turn, transfer the loads to the
wing spars. [Figure 1-5]
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In general, wing construction is based on one of three
fundamental designs:
            </p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left:40px ;">1. Monospar</p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left:40px ;">2. Multispar</p>
            <p class="text" style="margin-left:40px ;">3. Box beam</p>
            <p class="text">The monospar wing incorporates only one main spanwise or
                longitudinal member in its construction. Ribs or bulkheads
                supply the necessary contour or shape to the airfoil. Although
                the strict monospar wing is not common, this type of design
                modified by the addition of false spars or light shear webs
                along the trailing edge for support of control surfaces is
                sometimes used.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The multispar wing incorporates more than one main
longitudinal member in its construction. To give the wing
contour, ribs or bulkheads are often included.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The box beam type of wing construction uses two main
longitudinal members with connecting bulkheads to
furnish additional strength and to give contour to the wing.
[Figure 1-6] A corrugated sheet may be placed between
the bulkheads and the smooth outer skin so that the wing
can better carry tension and compression loads. In some
cases, heavy longitudinal stiffeners are substituted for the
upper surface of the wing and stiffeners on the lower surface
corrugated sheets. A combination of corrugated sheets on the
upper surface of the wing and stiffeners on the lower surface
is sometimes used. Air transport category aircraft often utilize
box beam wing construction.
